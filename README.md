  # Note Taker


  ## Description

  
  This application is used to take notes and save to an array of objects in the server. When the app is loaded and the user clicked on the "Get Started" button, the user is presented with the list of the notes he/she has taken. In the new window of the app, the user has the option to delete existing notes, and add new notes and save to the server.  The application will generate a uniqe id for each record and when the user deletes a record, the app rearranges the id's so that it is unique continuous.
